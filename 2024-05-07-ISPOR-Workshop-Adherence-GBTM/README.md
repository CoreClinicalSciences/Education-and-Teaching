# Supplementary Materials: 2024 ISPOR Workshop on GBTM

This repository contains the R scripts and data necessary to run group-based trajectory models (GBTM) using the `flexmix` package. 

GBTM are useful for identifying clusters of individuals following similar progressions over time within longitudinal data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have R installed on your computer. You can download it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Additionally, you'll need to install the `flexmix` package, which can be done using the following command in R:

```{R}
install.packages("flexmix")
```
